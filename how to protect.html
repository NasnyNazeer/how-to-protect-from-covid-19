<h1><b><i>Know How it Spreads</h1></b></i>
<h4><font color="black">There is currently no vaccine to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).<br>
	The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to this virus.<br>
	The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.<br>
        Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).<br>
        Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes.<br>
    	These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.<br>
